How I Completed the Project
Importing the Model
I began by setting up my project using Vite and configuring the essential components for a Three.js project, including the camera, scene, renderer, canvas, and more. Following this, I imported the fbxLoader and established its instance, incorporating a loadingManager to monitor the loading process and determine when all the necessary assets had been loaded. Once the loadingManager signaled the completion of loading, I proceeded to initiate the project. This approach helped prevent any potential loading complications and allowed me to manage the loading of files effectively.

Specifically, I imported the mesh of the provided FBX model, arranged its position, and adjusted its scale to the appropriate dimensions. Additionally, I introduced ambient lighting, essential for visualizing the model due to the PhongMaterial utilized in its creation.

Creating a Line with GPS Data
For generating a curve from the given coordinates, I employed the Shape class's instance. This class facilitates the creation of 2D shapes using paths. The constructor accepts points, which is an optional array of Vector2 objects. By providing these points, a shape can be constructed.

To ensure a smooth curve generation, I imported the array of coordinates from another file. By employing the CatmullRomCurve3 instance, a seamless curve is formed using a series of specified points. This is achieved through the application of the 'Catmull-Rom' algorithm. I devised a function to iterate through the array of coordinates, converting them into an array of Vector3 objects. These Vector3 objects were subsequently used as input for the CatmullRomCurve3 instance. I encountered an issue related to the minimal differentiation between the provided coordinates, leading to an excessively small line. To address this, I mitigated the issue by multiplying the coordinate array values in both axes. Consequently, the bufferGeometry created afterward featured scaled coordinates.

With the CatmullRomCurve3 instance established, I proceeded to create a geometry and a corresponding material. This allowed for the formation of a visible line within the scene. Capitalizing on this line, I constructed an animation that guides the car along its path, ensuring alignment with the line's direction and encompassing the entire curve.
